# Learn C

C, the programming language, has always captured my attention for several merits. Firstly, I cannot help admiring
people who write C code everyday for a living; They earn my respect because they tend to have a better knowledge of
the underlying fundamentals and essential design decisions of a computer system. Secondly, as an application developer
I am standing on the shoulders of giants (i.e. Unix operating system, web server, database server and many other
programming languages, softwares and libraries) that were written in C which make my life easier and happy. Last but not
least, C is not a big language yet its power is only limited by your (the creater's) imagination.

Now it's time for me to really learn the language "C". Diving down another layer below my comfort zone, enlightening
myself a little with the beauty of the inner mechanical of tools I always take for granted and embracing the power of
the language to my arsenal.

## Disclaimer
It does need a great deal of dedication and experience to write a program well whether you are using C or any other language.
Some programming languages might make things easier for certain tasks but not others. Please use your own judgement when
choosing a programming language. Know your priorities, know your constraints!
